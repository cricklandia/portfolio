                        About
                    </h2>
                    <p class="p2">
                        I was born in Alabama to parents from Georgia and Illinois but raised
                        in Florida from a very young age. After thirteen years in the public school
                        system, I probably ended up falling into the "band nerd" category, though
                        at the time I would have liked to think I wasn't as nerdy as the others,
                        but hindsight is 20/20. Anyway, I continued that theme into college where
                        I majored in music with my principal instrument being classical guitar.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p2">
                        By graduation time, I was teaching private lessons out of a small independent
                        music store and continued that until I married my college sweetheart and
                        realized I needed something more substantial, so I became a state government
                        worker. This was a path many of us who graduated from Florida State University
                        took due to living in the state capital where the majority of jobs are
                        in government. The Florida Department of Education hired me as an IT specialist
                        on an operations team in the Bureau of Educator Certification. It was my
                        first job in the professional world, and I enjoyed it, but after four years
                        there my wife’s father began a life changing battle with cancer which rendered
                        him partially paralyzed and unable to work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p2">
                        With my in-laws living over four hundred miles away in South Florida,
                        we decided to relocate there to help support her family. Since I had already
                        been in the state government system, I naturally took another state job
                        which was at the child support office in West Palm Beach. After three years
                        of being there for my in-laws, my wife and I realized we preferred our
                        old life in Tallahassee. I was offered my old job back at DOE, so back
                        to North Florida we went.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p2">
                        It was after the return to Tallahassee that the marriage ended, which
                        left me without much of a reason to stay in Tallahassee. I had been with
                        DOE for a combined total of eight years by this point. I had no immediate
                        family there and not many friends, so it became obvious that a change needed
                        to occur, so that’s how I ended up back in my birth state. My strong familial
                        connections in North Alabama along with the area's burgeoning tech industry
                        made it an obvious place to call home. Since moving to Madison, I have
                        completed a second bachelor’s degree at Athens State University where I spent over three years
                        studying programming, problem analysis,
                        problem-solving, and software engineering.

                        For my software engineering capstone project at Athens State in Spring
                        2022, I developed an application for our customer on top of a preexisting
                        back end which was developed by the Fall '21 team. My team was responsible
                        for designing, implementing, and testing the front end requirements given
                        to us by the customer. With diligent communication with the client and
                        my team, we were able to develop a reliable product which pushed, posted,
                        rendered, and updated data between various user views and established connections
                        between the front and back end. The front end aspects that I worked on
                        were written in Vue.js and plain JavaScript. Other aspects of the project
                        included a Docker container environment consisting of NGINX, Django, and
                        Vue servers. Python was used for terminal commands and scripts to manage
                        the back end as well as to define data tables within the Django REST API.
                        Version control was all done through GitHub using terminal commands and
                        the Visual Studio Code integrated source control.

                        didn't think I would stay as long as I did but the flexibility in scheduling
                        and generous customers in Madison made it worth sticking around while I
                        looked for my first software engineering position after graduating.

                        After three years of absence, I returned to my previous position to find
                        that the department's educator certification technology systems were in
                        the process of being redesigned. Because of this, my responsibilities involved
                        working as a liason to the contracted application developers. It was during
                        this period that I became interested in programming as a career. Working
                        closely with our app dev team I became familiar with Agile methodology

                            At this point, I was a state worker outside the state capital so I was

                        My first time working in the "professional world" was in FLDOE's Bureau
                        of Educator Certification. At that time, men in the bureau were required

                        HP inkjet printer. After spending hours on hold with HP customer service,
                        we ended up just boxing it up and shipping it back to be replaced. That
                        headache was how I was introduced to the next ten years of being a state
                        employee. But despite the interesting first day, the job did give me invaluable
                        lessons and experience as shown below.

                        While still in college, a small independent music store in downtown Tallahassee
                        hired me to teach guitar lessons. On my days not teaching I would open
                        and close the store, work the counter, and assist customers with questions
                        about merchandise.
