              About
            </h2>
            <p class="p2">
              I was born in Alabama to parents from Georgia and Illinois but raised
              in Florida from a very young age. After thirteen years in the public school
              system, I probably ended up falling into the "band nerd" category &mdash; though
              at the time I would have liked to think I wasn't as nerdy as the others,
              but hindsight is 20-20. Anyway, I continued that theme into college where
              I majored in music with my principal instrument being classical guitar.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
              By graduation time, I was teaching private lessons out of a small independent
              music store and continued that until I married my college sweetheart and
              realized I needed something more substantial, so I became a state government
              worker. This was a path many of us who graduated from Florida State University
              took due to living in the state capital where the majority of jobs are
              in government. The Florida Department of Education hired me as an IT specialist
              on an operations team in the Bureau of Educator Certification. It was my
              first job in the professional world, and I enjoyed it, but after four years
              there my wife’s father began a life changing battle with cancer which rendered
              him partially paralyzed and unable to work.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
              With my in-laws living over four hundred miles away in South Florida,
              we decided to relocate there to help support her family. Since I had already
              been in the state government system, I naturally took another state job
              which was at the child support office in West Palm Beach. After three years
              of being there for my in-laws, my wife and I realized we preferred our
              old life in Tallahassee. I was offered my old job back at DOE, so back
              to North Florida we went.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
              It was after the return to Tallahassee that the marriage ended, which
              left me without much of a reason to stay in Tallahassee. I had been with
              DOE for a combined total of eight years by this point. I had some local friends, but no immediate family, so it became obvious that a change needed
              to occur, so that’s how I ended up back in my birth state. My strong familial
              connections in North Alabama along with the area's burgeoning tech industry
              made it an obvious place to call home. Since moving to Madison, I have
              completed a second bachelor’s degree at Athens State University where I spent over three years
              studying programming, problem analysis,
              problem-solving, and software engineering.

              Classroom Experience
            </h2>
            <p class="p2">
              For my software engineering capstone project at Athens State in Spring
              2022, I developed an application for our customer on top of a preexisting
              back end which was developed by the Fall '21 team. My team was responsible
              for designing, implementing, and testing the front end requirements given
              to us by the customer. With diligent communication with the client and
              my team, we were able to develop a reliable product which pushed, posted,
              rendered, and updated data between various user views and established connections
              between the front and back end. The front end aspects that I worked on
              were written in Vue.js and plain JavaScript. Other aspects of the project
              included a Docker container environment consisting of NGINX, Django, and
              Vue servers. Python was used for terminal commands and scripts to manage
              the back end as well as to define data tables within the Django REST API.
              Version control was all done through GitHub using terminal commands and
              the Visual Studio Code integrated source control.

              After three years of absence, I returned to my previous position to find
              that the department's educator certification technology systems were in
              the process of being redesigned. Because of this, my responsibilities involved
              working as a liason to the contracted application developers. It was during
              this period that I became interested in programming as a career. Working
              closely with our app dev team I became familiar with Agile methodology
              and the software development lifecycle as it pertained to my department's
              project.

                At this point, I was a state worker outside the state capital so I was
                given a small pool of options for employment if I was going to continue
                my public sector trajectory. Luckily I landed what might end up being the
                most bizarre job of my career, which was at the Child Support Enforcement
                office in West Palm Beach. The population diversity of South Florida is
                unlike anywhere I had ever lived, and the cast of characters I had the
                pleasure of interviewing (with glass separating us) taught me more about
                the human condition than anything else up until this point. More often
                than interviewing clients in an interviewing room, I was seated at my desk,
                tasked with compiling financial and employment data and creating in house
                child support orders. These were known as administrative orders as opposed
                to judicial orders created by the courts.

              My first time working in the "professional world" was in FLDOE's Bureau
              of Educator Certification. At that time, men in the bureau were required
              to wear ties, so I think that's what makes me say "professional". On my
              first day my supervisor gave me the task of troubleshooting an inexpensive
              HP inkjet printer. After spending hours on hold with HP customer service,
              we ended up just boxing it up and shipping it back to be replaced. That
              headache was how I was introduced to the next ten years of being a state
              employee. But despite the interesting first day, the job did give me invaluable
              lessons and experience as shown below.

              While still in college, a small independent music store in downtown Tallahassee
              hired me to teach guitar lessons. On my days not teaching I would open
              and close the store, work the counter, and assist customers with questions
              about merchandise.
